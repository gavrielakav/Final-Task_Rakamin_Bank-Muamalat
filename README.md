## 👍Recommendations

Based on the insights, here are the recommendations :
- Add movie showings with ratings (Tv-MA and R) in African countries with a movie duration of 2 hours.
  
- Add TV shows with a duration of 1 season only from the TV-MA rating.
  
- Adding new content and ratings in African countries: by adding more content and ratings in countries in the African region, more and more audiences will be interested in watching films from the African region.
  
- Market Trends: Stay updated on industry trends, both globally and locally. Trends in content consumption, technology, and audience behavior can inform content development strategies. For instance, if short-form content is trending, consider producing more short films or series.
